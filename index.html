            <p>The <a target="blank" href="http://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> is hosting a live, 24-hour Telethon during our end-of-year fundraising period! With a variety of guests, activities and surprises, we hope you'll make a donation to our goal and watch the fun!</p>

            <p>Your hosts are Jason and Michelle, and they are going to be providing non-stop entertainment and education about the mission and goal of the <a target="blank" href="http://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> from Noon on December 19th through to Noon on December 20th.</p>

            <p>We're doing this to bring attention to the treasure of the <a target="blank" href="http://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>, which for nearly 20 years has been involved in history (through our Wayback Machine), collections of items (such as our books, music, movies, and software), and analysis of television news. Millions visit the Archive's pages every year, for research, entertainment, education, and insight. We're hoping you'll be inspired to make this year's fundraising our best yet! </p>

            <p>The <a target="blank" href="http://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that was founded to build an Internet library. Its purposes include offering permanent access for researchers, historians, scholars, people with disabilities, and the general public to historical collections that exist in digital format.</p>
            <p>Founded in 1996 and located in San Francisco, the Archive has been receiving data donations from Alexa Internet and others. In late 1999, the organization started to grow to include more well-rounded collections. Now the <a target="blank" href="http://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> includes: texts, audio, moving images, and software as well as archived web pages in our collections, and provides specialized services for adaptive and accessible reading.</p>
            <p>The <a target="blank" href="http://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> is working to prevent the Internet - a new medium with major historical significance - and other "born-digital" materials from disappearing into the past. Collaborating with institutions including the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian, we are working to preserve a record for generations to come. Open and free access to literature and other writings has long been considered essential to education and to the maintenance of an open society. Public and philanthropic enterprises have supported it through the ages. <a target="blank" href="http://archive.org/">The Internet Archive</a> is opening its collections to researchers, historians, and scholars.</p>
